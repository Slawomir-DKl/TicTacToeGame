# Tic-Tac-Toe game
## Idea:
Original idea comes from [Python Essentials 1 course](https://edube.org/study/pe1) by Python Institute. The game was a task finishing the course.

Initial requirements were quite simple, thus I've decided to develop the game further, e.g. by implementing the winning algorithm by [Świstak codes](https://swistak.codes/post/algorytmika-gier-kolko-i-krzyzyk/#strategia-wygrywania-w-kółko-i-krzyżyk) on the basis of the article ["Flexible Strategy Use in Young Children's Tic-Tac-Toe" by Kevin Crowley and Robert S. Siegler](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15516709cog1704_3)
